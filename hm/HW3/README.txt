ORDER NOTATION:
For each function, using the variables:
  n = size of the array
  h = the length of the longest history for one slot of the array
Include a short description of your order notation analysis 
for the non-trivial functions.

size:O(1)

set:O(n)

initialized:O(1)

get:O(1)

undo:O(n)

print:O(n*h)

basic constructor:O(n)

copy constructor:O(n*h)

destructor:O(n)



EXTRA CREDIT:
Discuss your implementation & order notation of push_back and pop_back.

push_back:O(n*h)

pop_back:O(n*h)
